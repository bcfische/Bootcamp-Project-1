Project 1

This project utilizes Python APIs, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebooks. We studied suicide trends in Arizona along with data from various
potential correlated sources, including Census (divorce rates, veteran population, and population growth rates) and NOAA
(climatological temperature data) datasets. The PowerPoint summarizes our analysis techniques and findings.
